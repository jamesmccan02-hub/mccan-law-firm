                <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
                <p>By accessing our website or engaging McCan Law Firm ("we," "us," or "our") for legal services, you agree to these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use our website or services.</p>

                <h2>2. Scope of Services</h2>
                <p>We provide legal services focused on cryptocurrency asset recovery, including investigation, legal strategy, litigation, settlement negotiation, and coordination with exchanges and law enforcement. Legal services begin only after execution of a written engagement agreement and fulfillment of onboarding requirements (including identity verification and conflict checks).</p>

                <h2>3. No Attorney-Client Relationship Without Engagement</h2>
                <p>Contacting us or submitting information via our website does not create an attorney-client relationship. Such a relationship is formed only after we confirm we can accept your case and a written engagement agreement is signed.</p>

                <h2>4. Disclaimers</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No Guarantee of Outcome:</strong> We do not guarantee recovery of funds or any specific result.</li>
                    <li><strong>Informational Content:</strong> Website content is for informational purposes only and is not legal advice.</li>
                    <li><strong>Jurisdictional Limits:</strong> Our attorneys are licensed in specific jurisdictions; services may be provided in collaboration with local counsel as needed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> We may work with forensic vendors and exchanges. We are not responsible for their actions, delays, or policies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>5. User Responsibilities</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide accurate, complete information regarding your case and promptly update us on changes.</li>
                    <li>Preserve evidence, including transaction IDs, communications, and records relevant to your matter.</li>
                    <li>Refrain from unlawful activity and comply with all applicable laws and regulations.</li>
                    <li>Pay fees and costs as agreed in the engagement letter, including any contingent or hourly arrangements.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>6. Fees and Billing</h2>
                <p>Fees, costs, and billing terms will be specified in your engagement agreement. You remain responsible for third-party costs (e.g., court fees, forensic analyses) unless otherwise agreed in writing.</p>

                <h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
                <p>We maintain confidentiality consistent with ethical rules and applicable law. See our Privacy Policy for details on data processing and GDPR compliance.</p>

                <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or lost profits, arising from or related to your use of our website or services. Our total liability shall not exceed the amount you have paid to us for services in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.</p>

                <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
                <p>You agree to indemnify and hold harmless McCan Law Firm and its personnel from claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneysâ€™ fees) arising from your breach of these Terms or violation of applicable law.</p>

                <h2>11. Third-Party Links</h2>
                <p>Our website may link to third-party sites. We do not control and are not responsible for their content or practices.</p>

                <h2>12. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
                <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the state in which your engagement agreement specifies, without regard to conflict of laws. Disputes shall be resolved in the courts specified in the engagement agreement or through arbitration if agreed.</p>

                <h2>13. Changes to Terms</h2>
                <p>We may update these Terms periodically. Your continued use of the website or services after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
